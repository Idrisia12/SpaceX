This project was developed following Eric Mathees' Python Crash Course, Second Edition. Its a the classic game, Alien Invasion, developed in Python using Pygame.

Aliens will try to Invade the Planet Earth in this game and Spacex rocket will be used to destroy them.
This is my first Project as a Pythonista so I will continue to work on it and further develop it by adding Sound, Instructions and High score button.
